# Simon
Simon handheld game

Simon is a memory game using colors and sounds. Each round a new button will be added to the previous sequence (i.e. first round may be green, next round could be green then blue, next green, blue, blue...etc). There is a certain time limit in which you can recall the sequence, if time limit is exceeded, you lose.
Strict mode : If strict mode is on, if you exceed the time limit or if you guess the incorrect sequence, you lose and go back to round 1. (Which is different from normal mode, in that it will offer the sequence to you again for you to guess again). 
If you make it to the 20th round and get everything correct, you win the game. 
Traditionally, there was no "Winning" and every round the button sequence would get faster to make it more difficult to remember. 
This version of Simon will have a display that shows which round you are on, an off/on switch and a button for strict mode.
